# Customer-Segmentation

In this project, I implemented the K-means clustering for segmenting the customers arriving in a mall into particular categories. I achieved this task by performing data cleaning, data analysis, data splitting, train and then using "Elbow Method", model training and prediction. Results are visualised using a scatter plot displaying the centroids of the segments as well.
