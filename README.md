# Customer-Segmentation

In this project, I implemented K-means clustering to segment customers in a mall into particular categories. I achieved this task by performing data cleaning, data analysis, data splitting, training and then using the "Elbow Method", model training, and prediction. Results are visualized using a scatter plot displaying the centroids of the segments as well.

I've created a basic Flask app which takes the # Annual Income and # Spending score of the customer as an input and predicts the customer bracket under which they will be classified. Also implemented a docker image of the model and deployed it on EC2 using the docker image from the docker hub repository.
